# Attendance-Recording-Using-Face-Recognition

Attendance Recording Using Face Recognition is a Python-based system that automates attendance tracking by identifying faces using computer vision. The project typically uses the OpenCV library for face detection and recognition, along with dlib or face_recognition for advanced facial feature mapping.

# Key Features:
1. Captures video input from a webcam to detect faces in real time.
2. Compares detected faces against a pre-trained database of known individuals.
3. Marks attendance for recognized faces and logs it in a CSV or Excel file.
4. Ensures accuracy with unique face encoding to prevent duplication.
5. Easy integration with systems for timestamps and daily records.

This project provides an efficient, secure, and contactless way to manage attendance, widely applicable in schools, offices, and events.
